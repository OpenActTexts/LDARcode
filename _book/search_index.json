This book provides R code that can help you understand and apply loss models concepts. Within the book, there are explanations available to guide you through the specific R functions used in a certain code chunk so that you can understand what the code is doing and why we need to use such a function. In order to use this book most effectively, it is helpful to learn and understand the following programming tools in R. By having this background knowledge, you can manipulate the given code to suit your application. Useful programming tools: Install and call packages within RStudio Assign values to variables Construct and select particular elements of Vectors Matrices Data frames Construct plots Histograms Lines Curves Multiple plots in one output Include labels, x and y limits, color and a legend Construct and call functions Construct loops Construct if else statements Read and manipulate data Read in files Take a subset of the data Get certain elements of the data The following are free sections within DataCamp courses that can help you understand these programming tools. Working with the RStudio IDE (Part 1) - Orientation (for 1) Introduction to R - Intro to basics, Vectors, Matrices, Data frames (for 2 and 3) Data Visualization in R - A quick introduction to base R graphics (for 4) Writing Functions in R - A quick refresher (for 5 and 6) Intermediate R - Conditionals and Control Flow (for 7) Importing &amp; Cleaning Data in R - Ticket Sales Data (for 8) "]
