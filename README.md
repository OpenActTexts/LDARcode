## Open Actuarial Textbooks Project Goal
The goal is to have the actuarial community author our textbooks in a collaborative fashion. *GitHub* provides a natural development environment to achieve this goal. See the [Open Actuarial Textbooks Project Site](https://sites.google.com/a/wisc.edu/loss-data-analytics/) for more information about this project.

# Loss Data Analytics

**Book Description** - *Loss Data Analytics* will be an interactive, online, freely available text.
* The online version will contain many interactive objects (quizzes, computer demonstrations, interactive graphs, video, and the like) to promote deeper learning.
* A subset of the book will be available for offline reading in pdf and EPUB formats.
* The online text will be available in multiple languages to promote access to a worldwide audience.

To see our progress, a draft of the book is available at 
* [Online Version](https://ewfrees.github.io/Loss-Data-Analytics/index.html) 
* [pdf version](https://github.com/ewfrees/Loss-Data-Analytics/tree/master/Offline/LossDataAnalytics.pdf)
